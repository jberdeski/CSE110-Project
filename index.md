# Who Am I and What Do I Do?
---
Hello! My name is Julia Berdeski. I am a second year student at UCSD (subcollege ERC) studying computer science. I was born and raised in Chula Vista, CA.

As a programer, I have dabbled in the programing languages: 

```
* Java
* Python
* C
* C++
```

> All of my experience comes from CSE classes offered at UCSD

***Have I introduced myself well enough?***

- [X] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] I don't know

## CSE 110

This quarter I am in CSE 110 taught by **Professor Powell**. 

### Lab 1 (April 3, 2023)

For this lab I created a GitHub User Page about myself for my GitHub account *Which is what this is!*
The steps for this lab consisted of:

1) Dowloading Visual Studio Code and Related Extensions
   
2) Downloading Git (if needed) and (Re)Familiarizing Ourselves with Git
  - First I created a repository on GitHub
  - Then I cloned the repository onto my local machine using `git clone` in the command line and used ` cd `  into the repo folder
  - From there I created a new git branch called "add-read-me" and navigated to that branch by using ` git branch ` and ` git checkout `
    
  [screenshot of the command line code mentioned above, how it was used, and what the result was](CSE110-Project/Screenshots/CSE110-Lab1.png)
       
  - After that I used ` vim `
    > ` vim ` opens a specified file and allows you to edit it. So in this instance I added "Julia Berdeski's User Page" in the file README.md
    > for a quick overview of ` vim ` you can check out [this](https://jberdeski.github.io/cse15l-lab-report4/vimSteps) other gitHub page I created in CSE 15L
  - Once I had saved and quit from editing README.md I used ` git add ` to add the updated file to git
  - Finally after all that I finished by using ` git commit ` and ` git push ` to commit to the remote branch

3) VSCode UI
   - Now I was tasked to go through a similar process in VS Code
   - I opened my repo through VSCode created a new branch using `git branch` switched to that branch with 'git checkout'
   - I also created a file titled PRIVATE.txt. In this file, I put my name and PID.
   - After that I created a .gitignore file in the root of my repository and added the path to this PRIVATE.txt file
