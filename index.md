# Who Am I?
---
Hello! My name is Julia Berdeski. I am a second year student at UCSD (subcollege ERC) studying computer science. I was born and raised in Chula Vista, CA.

As a programer, I have dabbled in the programing languages: 

```
* Java
* Python
* C
* C++
```

> All of my experience comes from CSE classes offered at UCSD

## CSE 110

This quarter I am in CSE 110 taught by **Professor Powell**. 

### Lab 1 (April 3, 2023)

For this lab I created a GitHub User Page about myself for my GitHub account *Which is what this is!*
The steps for this lab consisted of:

1) Dowloading Visual Studio Code and Related Extensions
2) Downloading Git (if needed) and (Re)Familiarizing Ourselves with Git
  - First I created a repository on GitHub
  - Then I cloned the repository onto my local machine using `git clone` in the command line and used ` cd `  into the repo folder
  -
